How did your rule that creates the sensor pico install rules in the new child pico? 
How did you ensure that your sensor picos were created before sending them the event telling them their profile was updated? 
How did you create a test harness for your pico system?
In this set up, the picos representing sensors don't need to talk to each other and the sensor management pico is the parent, so it has channels to each child. How could you provide channels between sensor picos if sensor-to-sensor interaction were necessary?
